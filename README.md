# Acronym ChatBot

This chatbot is the result of an intern hackathon-winning project I worked on as a part of a 5-intern team. The chatbot was built as a tool
to help navigate a work environment filled with many acronyms. The database this chatbot relies on has been replaced with a series of acronyms
that can be found in day-to-day life (think of TBH, LMK, etc.).

This is by no means an extensive list!

### To Run:
Follow https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/
as a tutorial to making your virtual environment and installing Flask.

Once you follow those instructions, activate the virtual environment by typing in: 
*     .venv\Scripts\activate

To run the app, type in:
*     flask run

And then click the given link to see the app!
